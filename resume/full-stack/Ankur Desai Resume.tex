		\begin{rSectionEntry}{Michigan State Unmanned Systems}{Nov. 2025 -- Present}{Software Engineer --- Autonomous Systems}{}{East Lansing, MI}
			\item Engineered autonomous drone payload delivery system on Nvidia Jetson, integrating MAVLink and Orange+ flight controller, capable of releasing packages from 70+ feet altitude with a precision of $\pm7$ feet.
			\item Constructed machine learning pipeline: curated a 5,000+ aerial image dataset and optimized YOLO inference using TensorRT on embedded CUDA hardware at 30 FPS.
			\item Researched and implemented advanced path-planning; compared A* and Dijkstra's algorithms, developing a custom A* based solution for efficient multi-waypoint autonomous navigation.
		\end{rSectionEntry}

		\begin{rSectionEntry}{ThinkStack --- Relationship Powered Note Taking Application}{Sept. 2025 -- Nov. 2025}{Project Lead}{}{East Lansing, MI}
			\item Developed a note-taking app using a chapter-and-page model, letting users organize projects, compose layered Markdown, and visually connect ideas with Neo4j-powered links.
			\item Built a modular React web app with Vite and Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive styling, component-based architecture, efficient batching algorithms using the marked library, and OAuth2 authentication.
			\item Designed and implemented containerized RESTful API with secure JWT-based authentication and CORS middleware, integrating PostgreSQL and Neo4j in a cohesive dual-database architecture.
			\item Led agile SCRUM team of 6 software engineers, coordinating sprints and communicating goals with client.
			\item Streamlined collaboration with CI/CD pipelines, boosting unit test code coverage to 87\%.
